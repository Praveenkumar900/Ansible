Consider a Playbook with multiple vars, tasks, handlers, metadata with over 2000 lines. This will be less readable.
We can split different sections and put them in different folders and within these folders we can have yaml’s.
Role: These folders are placed under one umbrella called Role.
Ansible will create the entire folder structure for us using this command:
> ansible-galaxy role init test   #Creating Role

#Ansible Galaxy:
Using Ansible Galaxy, we can create the Roles, upload them here and share them within the Organization.

#Folders inside Role:
Vars → To place Variables
Tasks → We can put all our tasks here
Meta → Questions, Approach, Versions etc.,
Handlers → Are Tasks but are executed only upon a particular Action.
Defaults → variables (Default Values when we don’t provide any Vars)
Files → We can put all the files we want to copy to Manage Nodes.
Templates → Dynamic Files
